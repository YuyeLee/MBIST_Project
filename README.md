Overview

This project implements a Built-In Self-Test (BIST) system for a 64×8-bit single-port SRAM using SystemVerilog. The design enables at-speed testing of the memory array to detect stuck-at faults, transition faults, and address decoder faults with minimal external interaction.

Features

✅ 64x8-bit single-port SRAM implementation

✅ Memory BIST architecture with MUX, comparator, address counter, and test controller

✅ Self-contained testbench for functional verification

✅ Timing constraints file for synthesis and simulation

✅ Modular design using synthesizable SystemVerilog
